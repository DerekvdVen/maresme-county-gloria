Welcome to my repository for the technical interview at Earthpulse. Here I will show:

- A flood analysis using radar data.
- An API to retrieve the results from the analysis.

## Getting Started

To get started, install uv for fast environment building:
https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/

### To see the results of the analysis:

Open app/analysis.ipynb in your favorite IDE

### To access results through the api:

```
uv run uvicorn app.main:app
```

Visit for the FastAPI interface: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

### Downloading the data

For simplicityâ€™s sake the data is stored in the repository. # move todo add download script

### The pre-processing script is accessible here
